# Final-Project
This is the final project for Clemson University's CPSC 3600: Networks and Network Programming course. The assignment was to take a 
communication protocol and program for sending commands to a virtual robot and receiving images from that virtual robot and improve 
its operation. In total, an improvement at a factor of about 1.18 was observed on average with the improved implementation. Most original
code, and a more detailed readme, can be found in the bmgeorg_mod folder.
