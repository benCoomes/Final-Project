buildJSON.py
Ben Coomes

Description: Made specifically for bmgeorg's program. Given the output of 
robotClient, this script identifies key:value pairs that represent a request
sent to the middleware and the time it takes to process the request. It then forms
a JSON file with the collected pairs. 

Currently, the script is incomplete and only prints out the collected pairs.

Usage: To pipe the output directly to the script from bmgeorg directory:
 ./robotClient 127.0.0.1 8000 1 2 5 | python ../buildJSON/buildJSON.py

More generically: 
./robotClient <robot client parameters> | python path/to/buildJSON.py
